# Essay Task 5
Implement a program that calculates `(a + b) / (c + d)` where a, b, c, and d are real numbers.
Input the numbers through console. The program should be implemented so that it is robust to
different types of input data.

## Tech Stacks
I use **Java** with **TestNG** as its testing framework.

## Test Cases
I provide **12 Test Cases** which test the program if:
- all inputs are zeroes
- all inputs are positive real numbers
- all inputs are negative real numbers
- all inputs are large numbers
- all inputs are small numbers
- all inputs are mixed random numbers
- the function returns Infinite if it is a zero division
- the function returns large numbers as a result
- the function returns small numbers as a result
- the function returns a precise number
- the function is commutative
- the function supports operation for any random numbers

## Dependencies
- testng
- slf4j-api
- slf4j-simple (provider)
- jcommander
